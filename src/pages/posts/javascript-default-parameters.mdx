# JavaScript Default Function Parameters.

In JavaScript when we call a function which expects some data to be passed in if you call that without passing in that data JavaScript will use `undefined.`


Let's understand this practically ‚öôÔ∏è



What the following function does is that it takes a name as an input and console logs it.


```js
function printName(name) {
  console.log(name);
}
```

Now if we call the `printName` function by passing in a name as shown below: 

```js
printName("frontendenthusiast");  
```
We'll get the following output.

```js
frontendenthusiast
```

Now lets call the same function without passing anything in

```js
printName();  
```
We will get `undefined` as the output in the console.

```js
undefined
```

`undefined` isn't that useful in most situations what if we can use a fallback if no name is passed into the function. Well for that we can use the `||` operator in JavaScript as shown below:

```js
function printName(name) {
  name = name || `Anonymous`;
  console.log(name);
}
```

The **Logical OR (||)** operator returns **the very first truthy value** and undefined is a falsy value so in the `printName` function it will return **Anonymous** which is a truthy value.

Now with the above addition of `||` operator if we call the function by passing in no value as shown:

```js
printName();

```
We will get `Anonymous` as the output.

```js
Anonymous

```

In ES6 we have a more compact way of doing the above which is to set up default parameters directly using the assignment operator `=` as shown:

```js
function printName(name = `Anonymous`) {
  console.log(name);
}
```

this returns default value we set using `=` operator in case no value was passed in.

```js
function printName(name = `frontendenthusiast`) {
  console.log(name);
}

printName(undefined);
```
The output of the above function will be `frontendenthusiast`
